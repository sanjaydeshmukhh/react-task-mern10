1. Create a new React Vite app using the filter boilerplate.
2. Within the src directory, create a components folder. Inside this folder, create Nav, Gallery, and About components.
3. Implement routing to define desired routes in the App component and the Nav component to enable navigation between   the components.
4. Create a utils folder inside the src directory. Within this folder, configure global Axios with a base URL of lorempixum.
5. Import Axios into the Gallery component. Create a function named getImages to fetch images from the API and store them using useState.
6. Render the images in the Gallery component's view. Include a button that calls the getImages function when clicked.
7. Modify the Gallery component to automatically fetch images from the API when it comes into view by using useEffect, rather than relying on the button click.
